## My Manifesto
> Doing that which you love is a never ending battle against every force that urges you to conform.  
There is no solace in conformity — there is only a warped view of who you are and who you want to be.  
Spend your short existence creating something, helping someone, and changing the world.  
Betray the Institution.  
Crush the establishment.

### Life
* Rules are made to be broken.
* Nobody knows what they're doing.
* Change is inevitable.
* Life is short.
* There is no definitive meaning of life.
* Just fucking be yourself.
* Always voice our opinions.
* Thought and speech filters are overrated.
* Even men need to cry sometimes.
* Nice guys never win.

### The Universe
* We'll never know everything about anything.
* I believe in God. Christ is my saviour.
* Religion should not be forced upon you by your parents or anyone else. Form your own religion if that's what feels right.
* We all need to have faith in *something*.
* Fate is real.

### Self
* Stop lying to yourself.
* Don't be afraid of your feelings.
* Don't be afraid to show your sensitive side.
* Be random and spontaneous. Who cares if people think you're weird?
* I am weird. A lot of people are afraid of that; but I just embrace it.
* "I don't do drugs, I am drugs." — Salvador Dali
* You're not even close to perfect, so stop trying to be.

### Relationships (Romantic & Otherwise)
* Be spontaneous.
* Don't be afraid to fall in love.
* Friendship is important.
* Always reach out to help a friend in need.
* If you find a girl that wants to watch soccer with you, she's a keeper.
* Love isn't restricted by age or maturity. Love is a feeling like any other — it just needs to find the right person before it reveals itself.
* Stop using pickup lines. They don't work. Ever.
* Don't keep secrets.

### Creating
* Just fucking build stuff.
* Sometimes making shit is the best cure for a creative block.
* We all started somewhere. Remember to help out young designers or craftsmen — you were once standing in their shoes.
* Always ask for negative feedback.
* Never *ask* for positive feedback. If your work is good enough, it will come naturally.
* Writing is an important skill for any creator.
* Make music.
* Experiment with every possible medium.
* Never stop thinking.
* Even stupid ideas can succeed. I bet bendy straws seemed like a dumb idea at first.
